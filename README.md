This is a Project Management Portal. You can add, view, update and delete projects once you have logged in. I have used PHP for backend, HTML and CSS for frontend and 
MySQL for database.

You can copy the project files in your local development environment, you need to have xampp installed on your pc and make sure it's up and running. Enter "localhost/filename" as a url in your preferred browser.
